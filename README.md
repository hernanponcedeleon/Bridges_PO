# Partial Orders Bridges
This is a prototype implementation of the synthesis and optimization algorithm for converting a set of Partial Orders into an Event Structure.

The optimization is based on Algorithm 1 of the article "Compact and Efficiently Verifiable Models for Concurrent Systems" submitted to FMSD.

An example using the Partial Orders of ARM Cortex M0 and Intel 8051 instructions is given in the [this](https://github.com/hernanponcedeleon/Partial-Orders-Bridges/blob/master/ARM_Intel.py) file.
