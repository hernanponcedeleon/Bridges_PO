# Partial Orders Bridges
This is a prototype implementation of the synthesis and optimization algorithm for converting a set of Partial Orders into an Event Structure.

The optimization is based on Algorithm 1 of the article "Compact and Efficiently Verifiable Models for Concurrent Systems" submitted to FMSD.
